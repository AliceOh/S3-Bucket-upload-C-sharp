# s3uploader
Content team s3 backup tool in C#

This is a C# command line project to build the S3 uploader tool with C# .NET Framework for Windows.

The purpose of this tool is to auto-search and upload the log files of all running readers on the Windows PC to AWS S3 bucket so that we can have logs to analyze when the bugs are reported after 1 week which is the life span of logs on Windows control boxes.
